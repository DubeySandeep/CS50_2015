0.  BMP: 32 bit color, or over 4 billion
	GIF: 8 bits, 256 colors
	JPEG: 24 bit, 16 million
	PNG: 24 bit, 16 million
1.  Among those formats PNG supports animation.
2.  Lossy compression throws away some of the data in a file.  
    Lossless uses an algorithm to compress a file that is reversible, hence, 
    the quality of the file can move back and forth between the two states
3.  JPG is loosy compressed.
4.  FAT stands for File Allocation Table; when a file is deleted, the information in the
    address table is erased, but the file itself remains on the hard drive.
5.  Delete files using a secure delete option. That replaces the section on disc with all zeroes.
6.  The stdint.h header shall declare sets of integer types                   
    having specified memory, and shall define corresponding sets             
    of macros. It shall also define macros that specify limits          
    of integer types corresponding to types defined in other     
    standard headers.
7.  uintN _t designates an unsigned integer type with width N. 
    Thus, uint8_t,uint16_t,uint32_t denotes an unsigned integer    
    type with a width of exactly 8 , 16 ,32 bits respectively.  
    whereas int32_t denots a signed integer type with a width of 
    32 bits.
8.  BYTE is 8 bits; DWORD is 32 bits unsigned integer;LONG is 32 bits signed integer;WORD is 16 bits unsigned integer. 
9.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be
    set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.
10. biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure given in bytes (usually equals 40);whereas bfSize is the
    total size of the image and file i.e; biImageSize + 54.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down , and it confirs that the file is uncompressed.
12. Each pixel has R(red) G(green) B(blue) of 8 bits. so the total size for each pixel is 24 Bits. 
13. fopen may return NULL, in case if the file doesnt exist, or unable to open etc. so its for sanaty check.
14. The thir argument in fread is 1 is just for reading 1 pixel at a time.
15. if the biWidth is 3 then the no. of padding will be 1.
16. fseek() moves the position of the offset inside the file and helps to change its position.
17. this argumrnt is used inside the fseek() function to make the offset provided to the current position 
18. It was being done by Rob Bowden.
